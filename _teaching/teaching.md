Esther Hu joined the Boston University faculty in 2005 as an Assistant Professor in the Humanities (after earning a PhD in English from Cornell), having previously served on the full-time faculty at Chung Yuan Christian University in Taiwan.  At Boston University, Professor Hu has enjoyed teaching a diverse offering of courses ranging from Shakespeare to the required MFA course in Chinese to English literary translation, created and launched in Fall 2022. Having personally taught and supervised over 1,000 students from diverse linguistic backgrounds, cultures, and training, including preservice elementary school teachers, Professor Hu is a specialist in supporting students and helping them develop not just critical thinking skills, aesthetic appreciation, and historical consciousness but also acquire and develop their voice, grow their self-confidence, and broaden their intellectual horizons while at a residential research university. Her Shakespeare students have performed and co-directed their own Shakespeare play.
