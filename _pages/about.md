An Asian American academic from Taiwan, Esther Hu is a feminist literary scholar and historian who recovers (and uncovers) women’s voices. She specializes in showcasing the work of marginalized or forgotten poets, writers, missionary-educators, and other female thought leaders.

Dr. Hu is a specialist in the life and work of Soong Mayling (1899-2003), also known as Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the First Lady of China.

She is the author of [Soong Mayling and Wartime China, 1937-1945: Deploying Words as Weapons (Rowman & Littlefield 2025)](https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781666928617/Soong-Mayling-and-Wartime-China-1937-1945-Deploying-Words-as-Weapons), which focuses on the First Lady of China’s timely and critical contributions in the areas of war, women’s work, and diplomacy during China’s War of Resistance as inflected through gender.

The research monograph examines Madame Chiang Kai-shek’s work through her own words by discussing her speeches, essays, letters, telegrams, and news reports during the war period from archives around the world. How did Madame Chiang Kai-shek’s gender identity shape her interactions with other Chinese women, the male military and political leadership in the Republic of China, and the broader global public? How did Confucianism’s cardinal virtues and Chinese Christianity converge in Soong Mayling’s work and worldview? What were her main contributions as Secretary-General of the Chinese Air Force? Drawing on Chinese archival materials such as Chiang Kai-shek’s diaries and other records around the world, Esther Hu provides a historically informed perspective of the First Lady’s legacy within the context of World War II history, international cultural and military affairs, and transnational geopolitics. 

Dr. Hu is also the English translator of Soong Mayling’s most recent Chinese-language pictorial biography, [A Legacy of Grace and Resilience: Soong Mayling and her Era (Republic of China History and Culture Society 2023; Second Edition 2004)](http://www.rchcs.com.tw/bookdetail-1763.html).

Praise for Soong Mayling and Wartime China, 1937-1945: Deploying Words as Weapons (Rowman & Littlefield 2025):

In most English-language historical writing on wartime China, Soong Mayling appears as an interesting footnote, rather than a central figure. Esther Hu’s book provides a new perspective, revealing Soong Mayling’s important contributions as an orator, writer, and organizer who worked tirelessly to rally the Chinese people during a national crisis.— Peter Worthing, Texas Christian University

This compelling and meticulously researched study delves into the many dimensions of Soong Mayling’s contributions to wartime China from 1937 to 1945. Drawing on archival records, newly released sources, and contemporary scholarship, it brings Soong Mayling vividly to life with clear and engaging prose. A must-read for scholars and students of WWII history and modern China, as well as for general readers captivated by the legacy of Soong Mayling and the complex era of wartime China.— Peter Chen-Main Wang, Fu-jen Catholic University

Soong Mayling was the most influential woman of the Second World War, not just in China but anywhere. In Soong Mayling and Wartime China, 1937-1945 Esther Hu uses Soong Mayling’s radio addresses, public speeches, and letters as well as archival documents from around the world to illuminate her contributions to the war effort. Soong Mayling headed the Chinese air force, mobilized China’s women for the war effort, looked after the many thousands of orphans, and shaped allied relations and strategy by participating as an interpreter and interlocutor in meetings of her husband, president Chiang Kaishek, with other allied leaders. Hu insightfully compares Soong Mayling to Churchill, who through his persona and speeches mobilized Britain as Soong Mayling did China. This is the most detailed and by far the fairest account of a life that should be far better remembered.— Hans van de Ven, University of Cambridge
